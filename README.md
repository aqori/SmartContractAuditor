# SmartContractAuditor

## Description

A decentralized ledger framework leveraging zk-SNARKs for scalable privacy-preserving transactions and utilizing a novel Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus algorithm for enhanced network resilience.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for a SmartContractAuditor software project:
- "Analyzes Solidity code for vulnerabilities and provides detailed security reports",
- "Executes symbolic execution on smart contract bytecode to detect potential reentrancy attacks",
- "Supports automated testing of smart contracts using fuzz testing and propertybased testing",
- "Performs static code analysis to identify common programming errors and gas inefficiencies",
- "Provides a visual graph representation of smart contract call flows and data dependencies",
- "Integrates with popular blockchain explorers to fetch historical transaction data and contract metadata",
- "Offers a customizable risk scoring system based on weighted vulnerability metrics and industry benchmarks"
- Let me know if you'd like me to generate more!
